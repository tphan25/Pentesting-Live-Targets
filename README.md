# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection

Our first vulnerability in the blue site is SQL Injection. By manipulating the URL, we are able to inject a SQL query into the table containing user IDs. In the depicted example, I made the page sleep for 5 seconds by entering ' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'at the end of the URL (which the browser encodes some of our special characters to %27, %20) during its query.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation

GIF Walkthrough:

Our second vulnerability in the blue site is session hijacking/fixation. I demonstrated session hijacking. In my Firefox client on the right, I was logged in, and using the hack tool provided I retrieved the current session ID. Using this session ID and the hack tool, I changed the left side Chrome client's session ID (which was initially not logged in) to the same session ID as the Firefox client, which allowed for me to log in and hijack the Firefox client's session.


## Green

Vulnerability #1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

GIF Walkthrough:

Our first vulnerability in the green site is cross site scripting. We can actually submit a feedback form containing a script in it (in this case we alert the person who views our feedback). By submitting a script in the feedback form, a user with privileges to view feedback will end up running the script when they view the feedback, which we show in the gif when we check the feedback page on our own account. The script we ran was a simple alert script, 

<script>alert('Tam found the XSS!');</script>

which can be seen near the end of the gif (after several other alerts submitted by other students).

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

GIF Walkthrough:

Our first vulnerability in the red site is insecure direct object reference. When looking at a salesperson's page, the ID of the salesperson is actually used in the URL to navigate to the page for that respective salesperson. We can manipulate the URL by changing the ID in it to another integer value, and discover hidden links such as the one found in user ID 10.

# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection

GIF Walkthrough:

Our first vulnerability in the blue site is SQL Injection. By manipulating the URL, we are able to inject a SQL query into the table containing user IDs. In the depicted example, I made the page sleep for 5 seconds by entering ' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'at the end of the URL (which the browser encodes some of our special characters to %27, %20) during its query.
